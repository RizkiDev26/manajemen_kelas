# User Edit Page Error Fix - July 21, 2025

## Error Encountered
```
CodeIgniter\Exceptions\RuntimeException
View themes: no current section.
SYSTEMPATH/View/View.php at line 430
```

## Root Cause
The `edit.php` view file was corrupted with duplicate content:
- The file had a proper Tailwind CSS template that ended correctly with `<?= $this->endsection() ?>`
- But then it had leftover Bootstrap template code appended after the proper ending
- This caused CodeIgniter's view parser to fail because it encountered malformed template sections

## Problem Structure
```php
// PROPER TEMPLATE (Tailwind CSS)
<?= $this->extend('admin/layout') ?>
<?= $this->section('content') ?>
<!-- ... proper content ... -->
<?= $this->endsection() ?>

// LEFTOVER CONTENT (causing error)
<div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
    <!-- ... Bootstrap template remnants ... -->
</div>
<!-- ... more orphaned HTML/PHP code ... -->
```

## Solution Applied
✅ **Removed all duplicate/orphaned content** after the proper `<?= $this->endsection() ?>`
✅ **File now ends cleanly** with just the proper template structure
✅ **Modern Tailwind CSS design** is preserved

## File Fixed
- **File**: `app/Views/admin/users/edit.php`
- **Action**: Removed ~260 lines of duplicate/malformed content
- **Result**: Clean, properly structured view template

## Testing
The user edit page at `http://localhost:8080/admin/users/edit/2` should now work properly with:
- ✅ Modern Tailwind CSS design
- ✅ Proper form functionality
- ✅ No more RuntimeException errors
- ✅ All user edit features working

## What Was Removed
- Duplicate email field
- Duplicate role selection
- Duplicate walikelas field  
- Bootstrap CSS styling conflicts
- Malformed optgroup structures
- Incomplete form elements
- Extra JavaScript functions
- Orphaned HTML closing tags

The file now contains only the clean, modern Tailwind CSS template that was designed earlier.
